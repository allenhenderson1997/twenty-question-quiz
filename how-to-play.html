        <span>About The Game</span>
        <p>Thank you for playing The Simple Quiz. Make sure you read this page first to know how to play the game before you just go to "play the game".</p>

        <span>How To Play</span>
        <p>At the top, you will notice how many questions you have gotten right; that's on the left. Now, on the right, that's how many questions you got incorrect.</p>

        <pÃ¸>Here's how the game works</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Click "Play The Game"</li>
            <li>Read the question</li>
            <li>Once you feel like you know the answer, click the button that says "Answer this question".</li>
            <li>After that, watch your "amount of questions correct" increase.</li>
        </ol>

        <span>To Win</span>
        <p>The ways of winning are as follows....</p>

        <ul class="medals-rewards">
            <li>0-5 questions = No medal</li>
            <li>5-10 questions correct = Bronze medal</li>
            <li>15-20 questions correct = Silver medal</li>
            <li>20 questions correct = Gold medal</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The more questions you get right, the more medals you are winning.</p>
