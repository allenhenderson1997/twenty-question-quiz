Thank you for downloading "20 Questions Quiz"!

It is very easy to figure out how to play this game. Please follow the instructions below on playing the game.

1. In the upper right hand corner of the screen, click/tap "How To Play".
2. Read over the instructions on playing the game and the rubric for playing the game.
3. Click on "Play The Game" in the top right corner, next to where you clicked "How To Play".
4. Read over the question that is there.
5. Click the blue button that says "Answer The Question".

That is the button you will push to answer each question.
6. Type your answer in.
7. At the top, you will notice the "Q's correct" increasing as you answer the questions correct and vice versa for when your answers are incorrect.
8. Once you answer the questions, click the button at the bottom that says "What medal did I get?".

In my game, I have several things used here. 

-   When you view the first page, you should see a very nice looking navigation bar; completely made that with pure CSS FlexBox.
-   When you go to answer the questions on the "Questions" page, you will see buttons to answer each question. As you answer each question, you should notice the number increasing based on whether or not you're answering the question correct. I used a function to make a total number of questions you got right.
-   When I was optimizing this project for a smaller screens, like iPhones, I tried avoiding the "hamburger icon", but I ended up implementing it into my project and it wasn't difficult to learn how to create it. It actually made sense how it works.

*PLEASE NOTE: Due to the video background in two of the pages, you will need to play the game using FireFox. Google Chrome does not want to autoplay the video for some reason.
